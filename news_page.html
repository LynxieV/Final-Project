      <h2>Alzheimer's Destroys The Brain Cells That Keep Us Awake</h2>

      <div class="summary" style="height: 200px;">
      <p id="study">This article goes into detail about a recent study from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF).
      UCSF has found evidence to supportthat Altzheimer's is destroying the brain cells that keep us awake.
      The evidence comes from an analysis of post-mortum brain cells of thirteen patients with Altzheimers
      and 7 people who have healthy braincells. According to lead author Jun Oh, who researches memory and ageing at UCSF,
      "[The degeneration is] remarkable because it's not just a single brain nucleus that's degenerating,
      but the whole wakefulness-promoting network."
      In other words, this study has revealed another way that Altzheimer's can be identified.

        <p id="deme_study">
          This article discusses how a study conducted by the U.S. National
          Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)
          has noticed that taking action to reduce high blood pressure with
           prevention or intensive treatment for it, can reduce
          the risk of potential neurological disfunction. In fact,
          during the release of these findings Dr. Richard Hodes,
          who is the director of the U.S. National Institute on Aging said,
          "These findings [are] encouraging as we
          continue to advance the science of understanding and addressing
          the complexities of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's and
          related dementias." Overall this article, is interesting
          because it captures another milestone in the quest to understanding
          dementia fully.

    <h1> Altzheimer's and Dementia </h1>
    <h1> What is Alzheimer's?</h1>
    <h2> Overview
      <p>
        Altzheimer's is a progressive disease that affects people's memory over time.
        <br>
        The name originates from a 1960's German physician, Dr. Alois Alzheimer,
        who treated a woman who experienced the symptoms that today we call Altzheimer's disease.
        <br>
        It does this by killing a person's brain cells over time.
        <br>
        People with this disease are known to experience confusion and memory loss.
        <br>
        Unfortunately, there is no cure for Altzheimer's disease yet.

    <h1> What is Dementia? </h1>
    <h2> Overview
      <br>
      <p>
        Dementia is a progressive disease that affects how a person thinks, their behaviour and even their ability to perform everyday tasks.
        <br>
        Over a time period of months to even years, people with dementia lose their memory â€” at first for recent events,
        <br>
        and then eventually for events further back in their lives. There are some treatments that are available to treat this disease but,
        <br>
        there is no cure for progressive dementia.
